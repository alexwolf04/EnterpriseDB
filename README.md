# EnterpriseDB

EnterpriseDB is an advanced company database schema implemented in Microsoft SQL Server.  
It models core business entities such as employees, departments, projects, performance reviews, salary history, and time-off requests. This project demonstrates key database design concepts including:

- Relational schema design with primary and foreign keys  
- Many-to-many relationships via join tables  
- Data integrity through constraints and checks  
- Sample data insertion for testing and demo  
- Use of advanced data types and constraints  


## Features

- **Departments**: Stores company departments and locations  
- **Employees**: Employee records linked to departments  
- **Projects**: Company projects with start/end dates  
- **EmployeeProjects**: Assignments linking employees to projects (many-to-many)  
- **PerformanceReviews**: Tracks employee performance ratings and comments  
- **SalaryHistory**: Records salary changes over time  
- **TimeOffRequests**: Manages employee leave requests with approval status  

 

## Skills Demonstrated

- Database schema design  
- SQL Server-specific syntax (IDENTITY, CHECK constraints, FOREIGN KEY)  
- Relational integrity and normalization  
- Writing complex insert statements  
- Working with date/time data types and constraints
